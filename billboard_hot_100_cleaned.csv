River Washed Hair,Zach Bryan,"Remember when we'd sit around an ol' fire And you'd get your guitar out to sing We'd sing CCR, ""Jersey Giant,"" ""Don't Look Back in Anger"" Or anything by Bruce Springsteen Back when ol' Anna would throw her ol' hands up With her face framed by the fire And it got so late, we'd take hits from a joint Mistake shootin' stars for telephone wires And now I've grown partial to havin' a heart full Of memories I cannot bear The girls in summer clothes and Lord knows the soft scent Of her long, dark, river-washed hair And I think I might pack a bag in the night Find me some small town out west Start over, find closure and just say ""I'm sorry"" To that sweet girl who tore off that dress The way the moon's crestin' over green pines Restin' next to that coastline I rode It made me think of you in the dirt out in Santa Fe And all of the good times I stole Remember when Shawn was drunk quotin' Kerouac Remember when Steve quit the band I don't know nothin', but if I knew somethin' I'd know that I've helped all I can I think it's about time that I sever it You've never looked more needy or desperate And I've never been more worried about The state of the world, angry girl The time just stays passin', I think of my dad When the Army and Navy game's on And every night, I wonder if he's proud of the man Who threw fists that late night in his lawn I don't like bein' famous, they tame you, then paint you As someone that you've never been And I'm pissed that my mama can't see me singin' For this crowd out in deep Michigan And I'll leave you with somethin', don't leave with nothin' Be safe on your long drive home There ain't nothin' in this poor man's apartment Apart from bein' alone And I wish you were around this time of year Every time they drop that ball Drinkin' parkin' lot beers while the fire disappears Over Times Square and Webster Hall",98,90,53,4,2025,364
